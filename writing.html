        <p>Writing and poetry are central to the person that I am. Here's an excerpt from a book that I contributed to!</p>
        <h1><i>Why Do You Brew Coffee?</i></h1>
        <p> I wake up, seemingly before everyone else, and rinse my face with icy water. My sleep has been restless, filled with the chatter of my thoughts speculating on how this school year would unfold. My thoughts consist of regular pre-school anxieties. It’s also apprehension regarding the fact that I’ll be primarily responsible for myself and my three younger siblings as my parents both work during a fully-remote school year. I walk into the kitchen and simmer a mixture of cream, milk, sugar, vanilla, and cocoa powder on the stove. The fragrant and welcoming scent of hot cocoa seems to wake my siblings before I can. My seven-year-old sister trudges into the kitchen with a long face, so I comfort her. Like me, she’s probably worrying about how everything is going to play out.
        </p>

        <p> A week, then a month, then almost half a year seems to slip through my fingers. I have a chemistry test tomorrow, and I sit down at midnight to finish my lab. My sister’s anxiety has kept her up, and I find her in my room crying alone. I plait her silky hair, lull her to sleep with Somali ballads, and she is soon asleep peacefully. Leaving her in my bed, I take my laptop down to the kitchen and skillfully brew myself a medium roast infused with cardamom, cloves, and other spices common in East African teas and coffees. I pour rich cream over my aromatic cup of black coffee before sitting down to finish my lab. The effort it takes to crush spices, brew, cool, and froth reminds me of the acts of service that I can dedicate to myself, something I often forget I’m capable of. Not only is my coffee absolutely delicious, it also rejuvenates my tired mind and exhausted limbs like a magic tonic. With my flavorful coffee, I don’t need to compromise. I can be a comforter for my sister, securing her snugly; a stone golem, chasing away her worries; and a chemistry student, spending the night deciphering chemistry graphs and examining equations.
        </p>

        <p> The final month of the school year approaches quickly. I click on the Google Classroom link after giving myself a little pep talk. I’m a little nervous; I’m responsible for ensuring that the young girls I mentor in computer science finish their programming projects. Despite my nervousness, I am confident in their work. I take a sip of the hot cafe latte beside me, and the warm feeling of the drink permeates my chest. Its smoky and milky taste diminishes my nervousness and elevates my morale. On the other side of the link, I'm greeted by a welcoming teacher, and my shy (but undoubtedly talented) programmers. Minutes pass, and their reluctance turns into confidence. In around forty minutes, it's as though my mentees and I have known each other for much longer than we actually have. The time we’d spent together crafting, tweaking, and refining projects has shattered the uncertain atmosphere. They proudly display their creatively coded creations, each aspect of their projects laced with purpose and programmed as such.
        </p>

        <p> I often dedicate whatever pockets of time I may find between the busiest hours of my day brewing coffee for myself, or frothing the creamer for it, or crushing cardamom for it. The coffee-brewing ritual I undertake is a gift to myself, and it motivates me to care for myself as I continue to serve those around me. To dedicate time and effort into the relationships I share with others. To provide whatever direction I can offer, and to be a comforter. To fill the role of someone's coffee - to be their rock - is more than enough.
